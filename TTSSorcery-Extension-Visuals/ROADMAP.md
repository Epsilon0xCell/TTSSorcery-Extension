# TTSSorcery Extension: where it could go next

This is a reading of the repo as it stands, not a promise. Each item names the file it touches and the check that would prove it worked. Anything that needs a decision from me first is marked as a decision, not a task.

## First, the honest gaps

- No test files exist yet. The first real test should cover the path the flowchart sheet draws, start to finish, because that is the path a user actually takes.
- No continuous integration config. Every check is a hand run, which means some runs get skipped when I am in a hurry.
- index.js is the largest file in the tree. If it grows much more, splitting it along the lines the components sheet already draws is the natural cut.

## Then, in order

1. Write down the run contract: inputs, outputs, and the failure behavior, in the README, in the words the flowchart sheet already uses.
2. Add the smallest test suite that pins that contract in JavaScript, and run it before every change, not after.
3. Decide the license question and close it. A decision either way beats another year of silence.

## Decisions only I can make

- Whether this project is finished as it stands or still growing. Both are fine. Drifting between them is what rots a repo.
- Whether the untested paths are acceptable risk for a tool only I run, or worth the hours to pin down.
